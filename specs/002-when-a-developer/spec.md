# Feature Specification: Demo Level on First Run

**Feature Branch**: `002-when-a-developer`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "When a developer or tester runs the game for the first time, they should immediately see a playable demo level with visible assets, allowing them to test and validate the game engine's capabilities without manual configuration."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What specific game engine capabilities should the demo level demonstrate? ‚Üí A: Movement + interactions + tilemap rendering (showcasing 2D tile-based environment)
- Q: What is the target frame rate for the demo level? ‚Üí A: 30 FPS minimum (acceptable for testing/validation)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable loading time for the demo level? ‚Üí A: Under 10 seconds (acceptable for demo purposes)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable input lag for player controls? ‚Üí A: Under 50ms (noticeable but acceptable for demo)
- Q: How should the system handle missing or corrupted demo assets? ‚Üí A: Show placeholder graphics and continue running

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or tester downloads and builds the game for the first time. Upon launching the executable, they are immediately presented with a functional demo level that showcases the game's core mechanics and visual assets. The user can explore and interact with the demo level without needing to configure settings, load files, or perform any setup steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game has been freshly built, **When** the developer runs the executable for the first time, **Then** a demo level loads automatically with visible game assets
2. **Given** the demo level is running, **When** the developer provides input, **Then** the game responds with expected interactions (movement, interactions, etc.)
3. **Given** the game executable exists, **When** launched without any prior configuration, **Then** the demo level displays properly without errors or missing assets

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the game executable is run on a system that doesn't meet minimum requirements? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum system requirements not specified]
- When demo assets are missing or corrupted, the system displays placeholder graphics and continues running to allow testing of core functionality
- What happens if the game is run in a headless environment (no display)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically load a demo level when the game executable is launched for the first time
- **FR-002**: System MUST display visible game assets (graphics, sprites, tiles) in the demo level without manual configuration
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable basic player interactions in the demo level (movement, actions)
- **FR-004**: Demo level MUST showcase core game engine capabilities including player movement, basic interactions with objects, and 2D tilemap rendering
- **FR-005**: System MUST load the demo level without requiring any user configuration or setup steps
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow developers and testers to validate game functionality through the demo level
- **FR-007**: Demo level MUST be accessible on every first run without persistent state requirements
- **FR-008**: System MUST display placeholder graphics when demo assets are missing or corrupted, allowing the demo to continue running for core functionality testing

### Key Entities
- **Demo Level**: A pre-configured game level that contains representative assets and interactive elements to showcase engine capabilities
- **Game Assets**: Visual elements (sprites, tiles, textures) that are displayed within the demo level
- **Player Character**: The controllable entity within the demo level that responds to user input
- **Interactive Elements**: Objects within the demo level that the player can interact with (e.g., doors, items, pickups) to demonstrate basic interaction mechanics

### Performance & UX Requirements
- **Frame Rate**: Demo level must maintain minimum 30 FPS for acceptable testing and validation experience
- **Loading Time**: Demo level must load within 10 seconds to be acceptable for demo purposes
- **Response Time**: Player input lag must be under 50ms for acceptable demo responsiveness
- **Visual Quality**: Demo assets must be clearly visible and properly rendered [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: resolution requirements, supported graphics modes not specified]
