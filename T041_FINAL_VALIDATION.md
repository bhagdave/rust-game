## Performance Analysis

### Benchmark Insights

#### Micro-benchmarks (nanosecond range)
- **Single point**: 3.76 ns → Excellent, minimal overhead
- **Wax intensity**: 843 ps → Negligible cost
- **Per-frame update**: 1.42 ns → Outstanding

#### Macro-benchmarks (microsecond to millisecond range)
- **Grid 100**: 39.72 µs → Simulates low-res fragment shader
- **Grid 500**: 846.17 µs → Simulates medium-res fragment shader
- **Grid 1000**: 3.23 ms → Simulates high-res fragment shader
- **Grid 2000**: 16.12 ms → Stress test (4M calculations)

#### Scalability Analysis
- **Multiple lights**: Linear scaling (76.72 ns for 20 lights ≈ 3.8 ns per light)
- **Grid calculations**: O(n²) as expected (quadratic with grid dimension)

### Optimization Opportunities Identified

1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - `Vec2::distance_squared`: 1.11 ns (fastest, no sqrt)
   - `Vec2::distance`: 1.18 ns (standard)
   - Manual calculation: 440 ps (compiler optimized)
   - **Recommendation**: Use `distance_squared` when exact distance not needed

2. **Light Culling**:
   - For >20 lights, consider spatial hashing or culling
   - Current performance: 76.72 ns for 20 lights (acceptable)

3. **Caching**:
   - Static scenes could cache lighting calculations
   - Dynamic scenes perform well with current algorithm
