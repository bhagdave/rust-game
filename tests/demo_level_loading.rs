/// - Loads demo level from assets/levels/demo.ron within 10 seconds
/// - Spawns player at correct position from level data
/// - Spawns all entities from level data with correct components
/// - Attaches DemoMarker component to all demo entities
///
/// **Expected Result**: All tests FAIL initially (TDD - tests before implementation)
